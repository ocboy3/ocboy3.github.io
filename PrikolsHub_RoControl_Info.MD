This is a revival of RoControl written in Python. This is a remote admin similar to the original RoControl and BloxCord.

# Terms of Service

While using PrikolsHub RoControl, make sure you follow Discord's TOS, Roblox's TOS and Community Standarts.
As well, you also have to follow the PrikolsHub RoControl rules:

**1. No Abusing Commands** - Do not spam commands or load images in sessions which the owner is in, or you will receive the banned role, making you unable to use any `/session` commands.

**2. No Leaking Script & Invite** - Simple. Just don't give away the script and invite to the discord. (Or you will get kicked or banned based on severity)

# Privacy Policy

By using PrikolsHub RoControl, you agree to these privacy policies:

By sending messages in a session, your nickname and message will be forwarded to the Roblox Server where it will be displayed in the chat to other players. You can opt out of sending your nickname by using the `/utility anonymous` slash command.

By using any `/session` command that sends requests to the Roblox Server, your Discord User ID will be passed along in the command arguments to the server.

The `/session image` command will download the image linked in the command argument to the `imgconvert-cache` folder, convert it and display it in the Roblox server to other players.

Your messages sent from Roblox will stay in the session/archive forever until the channel or the message gets deleted.
